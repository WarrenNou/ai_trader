Summary of fixes applied to 7. dip_contra_fees.py

PROBLEM FIXED:
Error: 'Position' object has no attribute 'asset_type'

SOLUTION:
Changed all instances of:
    position.asset_type
To:
    position.asset.asset_type

SPECIFIC CHANGES:
1. Line ~344: Fixed position sizing calculation in log_performance method
2. Line ~699: Fixed stop loss storage key generation

ROOT CAUSE:
- Position objects in Lumibot have an 'asset' attribute that contains the Asset object
- The Asset object has the 'asset_type' attribute, not the Position object directly
- The code was trying to access position.asset_type instead of position.asset.asset_type

ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Added error handling for insufficient balance errors with helpful tips
2. Added buffer (95% of calculated amount) to reduce order failures due to fees
3. Added more robust type checking to handle None values

TRADING FLOW NOW:
âœ… Bot calculates position sizes correctly
âœ… Bot accesses position asset types correctly 
âœ… Bot provides helpful error messages when orders fail
âœ… Bot continues running without crashing on attribute errors

REMAINING ISSUES (Not Critical):
- Insufficient balance warnings (due to unsettled funds/pending orders)
- Type linting warnings (don't affect runtime)

The main crash bug has been resolved! ðŸŽ‰
