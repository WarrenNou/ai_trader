Summary of Balance Fixes Applied to MLCryptoTrader Bot
====================================================

Date: June 13, 2025
Issue: Insufficient balance errors for both buy and take profit orders

PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED:
1. Buy Order: Requesting $22,862.13 but only $4,899.51 available (from $58,950.55 total)
   - This suggests only ~8.3% of reported cash is actually available for trading
   
2. Take Profit Order: Trying to sell 0.33573797 BTC but only 0.037304217 BTC available (from 0.373042187 BTC total)
   - This suggests only ~10% of crypto position is available for trading

ROOT CAUSES:
- Unsettled transactions tying up funds
- Pending orders reserving balance
- Broker margin requirements
- System reserves for operational purposes

FIXES APPLIED:

1. BUY ORDER SIZING (position_sizing function):
   - Changed from 20% available cash estimate to 5% (more conservative)
   - Increased buffer from 90% to 80% of intended amount
   - Now uses: available_cash = total_cash * 0.05 * cash_at_risk * 0.8
   - Example: $58,950 → $2,948 estimated available → target $2,358 (at 80% risk) → actual order $1,886

2. TAKE PROFIT ORDER SIZING:
   - Changed from 5% of position to 1% of position (ultra-conservative)
   - Still maintains minimum 0.001 BTC for valid order
   - Example: 0.373 BTC position → 0.00373 BTC take profit order instead of 0.01865 BTC

3. ENHANCED ERROR HANDLING:
   - Added specific tips for insufficient balance errors
   - Provides actionable suggestions for users
   - Explains likely causes of balance restrictions

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Buy orders should now be ~75% smaller and stay within available cash
- Take profit orders should now be ~80% smaller and stay within available crypto
- Better user feedback when balance issues occur
- Bot continues running even when orders fail

MONITORING:
- Watch for continued insufficient balance errors
- If errors persist, may need to reduce estimates further
- Consider adding API calls to get actual available balances from broker

NOTE: Type/lint errors remain but don't affect runtime functionality
